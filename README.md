#### About this project  
That's my first take into creating something in data science area and it's not unique in any circumstances. In fact, it was the idea was taken from [**here**](https://github.com/DmitrySerg/memology) and some decisions were heavily _inspired_ by that repo. I just liked the idea and wanted to recreate this myself.
